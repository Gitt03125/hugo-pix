<h1 class="h1-formatting">Case Study: How we doubled Officeworks website performance</h1>

<div class="paragraph">
  <div class="text-block">
    <b>Industry:</b> Retail, eCommerce
  </div>
  <div class="text-block">
    <b>Summary:</b> In such a complex and fast-paced industry more and more consumers choose to do their shopping online.
    Hence, the website is the primary sales tool for companies these days due to the growing competitiveness of the
    eCommerce landscape. Officeworks is the largest supplier of office products in Australia; to be a leader in its segment it has to implement
    up-to-date solutions on a daily basis.

      <p>With Officeworks being one of the largest online retailers in Australia, traffic to our online store is
        constantly increasing. Overall site performance and page load times are therefore incredibly important
        to our success. A Google Speed Report revealed that one of the major contributors hurting end-user-experience
        was the size of images on our website. </p>

      <p>The team at Pixboost did a fantastic job of implementing their image
        optimisation service on our site, even going as far as building a custom HTML Snippet Generator for our content editors
        so that they could easily add responsive images anywhere on the website, optimising them for various user’s devices
        and screen sizes. </p>

      <p>By integrating Pixboost we have achieved great results, such as
        website time to first render improved by <b>34%</b>,
        website page weight decreased by <b>68%</b>, and
        image data optimised by <b>52%</b>. The service continues to run
        smoothly, helping us to boost the performance of our site and makes the process of managing and preparing images
        for the web so much easier.</p>

      <div class="text-header">The Customer</div>
    </h2>
    <div class="text-block">
      Officeworks is one of the largest online retailers in Australia with more than 40000 products presented
      on the website, and with more than 200000 images or these products and other digital media and services
      it provides. Their images broadband is 5Tb.
    </div>
    <div class="text-image"><img src="Officeworks-stats.jpg"/></div>
    <div class="text-block">
      Luckily we got a chance to work on this fantastic client as a SaaS and Consulting services provider improving
      image management, image performance and overall performance of the website. Because the Officeworks website is
      acknowledged to be one of the best eCommerce sites in Australia, its improvement was quite a challenge by itself.

      Let’s get into exciting details!

    <h2>
      <div class="text-header">Challenges</div>
    </h2>
    <div class="text-block">
      <b>Bulk optimisation of images.</b> 40000+ products with 200000+ images that are impossible to optimise and
      manage manually. It would take much time and effort to optimise this amount of image data using essential tools
      like Photoshop, Gimp or similar. So, the first task was to automate this process.
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <b>Proper sizing and image responsiveness integration.</b> The backend Product Information Management System has sizing
      limitations and were not able to produce images in the right sizes to fulfil the needs of proper image sizing
      across all devices and all browsers. Therefore, our second task was to implement image scaling on top of this
      system to solve the responsiveness problem.
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <b>Integration into various content sources.</b> Officeworks as a large retailer has an extensive IT infrastructure.
      As a result, it requires more than one source of content. Some of them are an eCommerce platform, CMS, PIM,
      single page apps and a few more. So, they needed several custom solutions for different parts of the application.
      Moreover, it was hard to estimate the costs due to such diverse infrastructure; therefore we had to come up with a
      tool that can calculate the service costs for Officeworks.
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <b>Image performance testing and monitoring.</b> When something is being done manually, there is always a place for a
      mistake as we all are only human. Especially difficult to search for errors when you have that much of image
      data. The processes of website performance testing and monitor needed the implementation.

    <div class="text-block">
      On the other hand, the competition gets stronger every day. With such prominent players as Gumtree, eBay or a new but
      strong player Amazon on the market it is getting harder to attract customers. So, to win the competition it is more
      important than ever to work on technological improvements such as website user experience, page load time, SEO, design.

    <div class="text-block">
      The weight of image content on a web page of online store gravitates on average towards 90% to the whole page weight
      these days. This is happening because online stores sell through showing images to the consumers. Therefore, image
      data is the most important for such websites but at the same time, the most resource consuming.

    </h2>
    <div class="text-block">
      Apart from Pixboost SaaS integration we have created a few custom-made solutions and provided training services for
      Officeworks employees. So, the solutions created and the services provided are:
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <b>Pixboost integration.</b> Through the integration of Pixboost we have improved the overall performance of Officeworks website by:
      <ul>
        <li>decreasing the page load time,</li>
        <li>reducing the images sizes,</li>
        <li>providing responsiveness support,</li>
        <li>providing CDN delivery of images,</li>

    <div class="text-block">
      Developed a solution architecture to integrate Pixboost Image Processing Platform with different modules of a website
      (CMS, PIM, single page apps). Moreover, we automated image optimisation and scaling process without the need of manual
      labour or third-party graphics editors (Photoshop, Lightroom or similar).

      <b>Cost Estimator.</b>We developed and successfully implemented a custom-made solution which analyses log files to calculate
      the daily volume of images traffic for Officeworks. This approach let us forecast the future cost of the service for
      the website of that size.

      for Officeworks website. They do not need to write HTML/CSS to insert images on the site which is very time-consuming
      for non-tech employees. We also provided training sessions for Marketing and eCommerce departments on how to use Snippet
      Generator and how fast images impact website performance. <a href="Optimisation-SnippetGeneratorGuide.pdf">Download optimization guide</a>.
