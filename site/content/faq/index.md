    - q: What transformations we support and why?
      a: |+
        We do our best to build a rock solid service which is easy to use. Therefore we value quality over quantity. So
        we chose to support **four basic endpoints**:

        * Resize to the needed size
        * Fit into needed space
        * Optimise image (automatically for up to 70%)
        * Returns image as-is through the CDN to boost its delivery

        We believe that this is enough to speed-up any website in seconds.
        Please check out our full API [here](/docs/api/).
    - q: What is image processing in the cloud?
      a: |+
        Image processing in the cloud is a practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to     
        perform image processing on digital images, rather than a local server or a personal computer. The
        major benefits are:
        
        * Easily scalable
        * No need of maintenance
        * No infrastructure costs
        * Safe and secure functionality
        * Access from anywhere
        * Reduction of labour costs
        * Easy integration and implementation
    - q: What and how we bill?
      a: |+
        We bill for the bandwidth. So, you pay only for what your website uses and nothing more. It’s as 
        simple as abc.

        * Imagine, you have a logo.png image which weights 1MB on your website.
        * We compress it to 600KB.
        * Let’s pretend that 100 users saw it.
        * So, the calculation would be: 600KB * 100 views = 60 MB of billed bandwidth.
        
        Sometimes, you can use more traffic then is provided with a plan you have chosen. Then we would 
        bill per each extra Gb you use accordingly to your plan. 

        Note: If you see that you are spending more on extra traffic, you may choose to upgrade to another
        plan any time. Even at the end of the billing period. And we will charge you by the new plan price.

        and powerful CDN providers. Its main features are:

    - q: How to benefit from Pixboost when building a responsive website?
      a: |+
        With Pixboost there is no need to create multiple images for all sizes of devices you would like to deliver by 
        hand. You keep only one master image, and automatically create all other derivative images of various sizes by 
        using Pixboost endpoints. We process your master image in a cloud and then keep derivatives in cache.
    - q: Why should I use Cloud Service?
      a: Two main reasons are you don’t have to build and deploy it yourself. Also, you can start or stop using it any 
        time. It will save your money and effort. Choose one of our [FREE or paid plans](/prices/).
